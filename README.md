# Stem Book Project
```bash
  Current version of the project:           Early - V.1.4.0
```

## What's Stem Book ?

Stem Book it's a school Project made by four persons; Adrián Castillo, Daniel Rivas, Salvador Mora and Yaris Horuk. Stem Book, it's an Android aplication about the Women science related, in which the user can find and learn about his favorite references.

## Project status

Currently the project it's paused / early finalized. Now we're not developing this project anymore because the group abruply end his activity due the lack of the proffesor that give us the project, so it can't be calificated.

This doesn't means that this project won't be finalized at any point, because Adrián, the main leader of this group in a future will complete the project as he always have done.

## Members

The project as we said before, it's made by four people, we made different roles for each person so we could organizate the job easier. But with the time, we saw that not all the members were involucrated as the same way in the project, being Adrian the one who became most involved in the project. But we need to make clear the effort made by Yaris and Salvador (a little) who came out as the support of the leader in the creative decisions. The last member remaining Dani, made less job than the other members, but the little work that he made, was a hard work so he can't be forgotten.

If we divided the project by ownership percentages, we would see that 70% of the project would belong to Adrian without doub
